# BigDataProcessing-LHL-FinalProject
Big data processing personal learning project using Apache Spark and Databricks.

Purpose: Understand and utilise the Apache Spark engine using Databricks to: 
1) Observe the capabilities of Spark to process 'big data' with increasing complexity (Metrics : Runtimes & Model Performance)
2) Observe the scalability of Spark by scaling up as well as scaling out compute nodes to observe the benefits of distributive computing (Metrics: Runtimes)
